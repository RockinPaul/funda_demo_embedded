# funda_demo

A technical assignment for funda.nl, implemented as Flutter module in the name of ability for integration with an existing native project.

Changes made in your module’s .ios/ .android/ directories do not appear in your existing project using the module, and may be overwritten by Flutter.
Do not source control the .ios/ and .android/ directories since it’s autogenerated. 
Before building the module on a new machine, run flutter pub get in the project directory first to regenerate the .ios/ and .android/ directories before building native project using the Flutter module.
